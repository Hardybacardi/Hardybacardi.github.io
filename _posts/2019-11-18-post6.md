# What is Open Graph?
With the help of Open Graph you can control the information which is to be represented while the website is shared on different platforms. 

# How did I make use of it?
I used Open Graph in the form of "meta-tags". Theese tags are to be placed in the head section. I used tags for title, type, url and image. the title is the name of the website, type defines in this case a website, url is the url to the website and image is a simple picture to be associated with the website.
