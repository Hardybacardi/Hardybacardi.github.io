# How I did it
I used the service called Disqus. It lets you implement their comments sections into your website. The service is free to use, you only have to register. Also it's very easy to implement on a given website. I have implemented it on all the blog posts whick is written in markdown. All you have to do to implement it in a markdown file is to add "comments: true" in the file. Also in "_config.yml" i have declared Disqus and given my shortname for the service.
