I think it's a great way to start with static site generators. I have been using Jekyll for this purpose. In the beginning it can be a bit much information that you have to process to get a hold of using Jekyll. But when you spend enough time and effort you quickly begin to understand the basic fundaments. I have been using markdown files to write content wich Jekyll supports. It's great.

# What type of projects are they suitable for?
They are suitable for a project that does not need daily updates. Everytime you update the site you need to rebuild the site. I would say a project like this very site is an excellent example of what types of projects you could use static site generators for. In conclusion, use static site generators for websites that do not require daily updates.
