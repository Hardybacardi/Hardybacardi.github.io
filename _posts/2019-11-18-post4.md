# What is humans.txt?
Humans.txt in a text file that contains information about the people who have worked on the website. Everyone who have contrubuted in any way should be mention in that very file. This way you can easy know who the people behind the website is.

# How have you configured it?
I have separated it in 3 sub categories, "team", "thanks" and "site". In the "team" category i have written the name och the individuals who have worked on the project and also basic contact information. Under "thanks" I am thanking people for their specific work on the website. And last under "site" there is basic information about last update, general information about the language and which IDE has been used.
